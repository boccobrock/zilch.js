                    Players roll the dice, scoring them as follows:<br/>

                    1 = 100<br/>
                    5 = 50<br/>
                    Three 1's = 1000<br/>
                    Three 2's = 200<br/>
                    Three 3's = 300<br/>
                    Three 4's = 400<br/>
                    Three 5's = 500<br/>
                    Three 6's = 600<br/>
                    3 Pairs = 1000<br/>
                    Straight = 1500<br/>

                    Each roll must have some value, otherwise it is a zilch and the player loses all their points.<br/>
                    Setting aside the dice that are being scored, the player may continue to roll the other dice to earn more points.<br/>
                    If a player rolls the dice and all the dice have value, the player may keep their points and roll all 6 dice again.<br/>
                    Rolling a zilch at any point causes the player to lose all points earned that turn.<br/>
                    If a player is not yet on the scoreboard, they must earn at least 500 points to save their score.<br/>
                    After a player goes above 10000 points, the other players have 1 turn to earn more points, whoever has the most points then wins.<br/>
